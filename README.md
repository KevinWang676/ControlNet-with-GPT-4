# 🌁🪄🌃 - ControlNet with GPT-4
## 🌟 Born to Create: Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with GPT-4

### Quick start: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KevinWang676/ControlNet-with-GPT-4/blob/main/ControlNet_with_GPT_4.ipynb)

P.S. You need to have a GPT-4 API key since GPT-3.5 would not work properly.
